#### Task:

Use the HTTP verbs to complete request to Dummy APIs.
The requests should ve visible in the page.

* GET request, results must be visible in the screen
* POST request, Body must be sent and then a get to see the new registry
* PUT request, Body must be sent and then a get to see the new registry
* DELETE request, Delete must be confirmed in screen
* Try-Catch: Handle the error and show it in the screen

#### Dummy APIs:

GET Showcase:
[Pizza App API](https://pizzaapp.docs.apiary.io/#reference/0/create-order)
POST Showcase:
[JSON placeHolder API](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts)
